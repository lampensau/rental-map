  "address": "Friedrichstra√üe 123",        // Street address 
  "city": "Berlin",                        // City

      "quantity": 5                        // Quantity in stock
    }
  ]
}
```

### CSV Format

The CSV file contains rental companies and their inventory in the following format:

```
KXXXX, street address, city, country, zip, web page, phone, email  // Rental company line
product-id, product name, manufacturer name, quantity              // Product line

The products belong to the most recently defined rental company above them in the file.

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the Admin Panel in the application
2. Click on the "Import" button
3. Select the appropriate format (CSV or JSON)
4. Either:
   - Upload one of the test files using the file upload option
   - Copy and paste the contents of a test file into the text area
5. Configure import options as needed (select which entity types to import)
6. Click "Import Data" to start the import process

### Testing Entity Resolution

To test the entity resolution functionality:

1. Ensure some of the manufacturers or products in the test data don't exist in your system
2. Disable the "Auto-create missing entities" option before importing
3. The system should detect missing entities and prompt for resolution

## Data Characteristics

- All rental company data includes real German addresses for testing geocoding functionality
- Various quantities of inventory items per rental company (1-4 items per company)
- Mix of different products from different manufacturers
- Some duplicated products across different rental companies to test aggregation

## Notes

- The IDs used in this test data (K1001-K1020 for JSON and K2001-K2020 for CSV) are distinct to help differentiate the source during testing
- All product IDs and names match those provided in the product-examples.md file
